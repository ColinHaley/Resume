I am a member of a rapidly evolving team of devops/support staff. I work side by side with application developers and traders to provide trauma support and fixes to enable near flawless up time for all clients.

I develop, maintain and update tools to proactively monitor the global environment (including non-trade spaces) to predict failure through custom built and deployed systems. I also assist in managing the Active Directory group memberships. A very large amount of my development time has been spent working on automation and time saving efforts to decrease lengthy processes and workflows. A few such examples:

+ Reduce an equipment reclaim workflow from ~60 minutes per machine to 30 seconds.
+ Standardized the Powershell dependency packages for Enterprise User Services
+ Created reports for use by support staff.
+ Automated maintenance and notification for local databases.
+ Created dozens of powershell functions to more easily query against the environment and assess risks.


I have led and participated many projects in my three years in the position:
+ Designed a full multi-database SQL Server Schema from ground up to store logfiles, reports and metrics queried from the global environment.
+ Designed a reporting aggregation platform and predictive failure and statistic tool. This tool aggregates the majority of the data from the aforementioned SQL Database to an easily readable format and integrates with many other systems.
+ Cleanup of IDF Rooms
+ Centralized the Enterprise User Services Powershell script environment and migrated it to a source control system.
+ Held powershell training sessions for organization-wide attendance.
+ Participated in a high profile project to provide a real time streaming solution to trading and corporate research groups.
+ Created a rolling backup solution for trading and developer client machines using USMT and WSMAN and a proprietary tool written by my team.
+ Large equipment moves involving coordination from multiple groups
